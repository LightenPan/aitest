Airgallet (c) 1996 Banpresto.

The player controls a fighter jet and shoot enemies in the air and on the ground, collects power-ups, and defeat bosses to advance levels. The player must collect four power ups to upgrade their weapon. There are four weapon types: L, a laser weapon, S, a support drone, M, a tracing missile, and F, gatling Fire, a spread-out vulcan bullet shot.

Four levels of power-ups are available for each weapon, however each level requires four power up tokens be collected. There are also two special "bomb" weapons available for collection - green Energy Spark for a screen-covering swarm of lower-power bombs and blue Thunder Drive for a narrower and more focused attack. The Energy Spark clears all bullets from the screen, while the Thunder Drive only clears bullets that actually touch the blast. This blast starts momentarily atop the player, but quickly moves forward a short distance and stays stationary for a few seconds before dissipating.</desc>

Aliens (c) 1990 Konami.

Aliens is a scrolling run 'n' gun game for one or two players based on the classic 1986 science-fiction movie of the same name. Players take on the role of either Ellen Ripley (in the single-player game) or Corporal Hicks (in the two-player game) and must shoot their way through the alien-infested levels of the LV426 base to make their escape together with 'Newt', the little girl who survived the alien invasion of her settlement.

Players begin the game armed only with a pulse rifle but will have opportunities to upgrade to other weapons, including flamethrowers and grenade launchers. Bombs can also be found that cause greater damage to the enemies. Each player life starts with eight health points which deplete upon contact with either an alien or an enemy projectile and once all health points are lost, the player loses a life. Each stage ends with a Boss encounter, with the game's final boss being the Alien Queen herself. 

As well as the standard side-scrolling stages, intermittent into-the-screen stages also feature that have the players riding atop the Marines' APC vehicle, shooting the hordes of aliens that swarm towards it.

As well as the standard Aliens and Face-huggers from the original film (that now come in a variety of different colours), there are many enemies that were created only for the arcade game and have never appeared elsewhere in the Alien franchise. These include flying aliens and mutated humans, as well as all end-of-stage bosses prior to the Alien queen.</desc>

Astérix (c) 1992 Konami Company, Limited.

Asterix is a horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players and is based on the French comic-book series, 'Asterix &amp; Obelix'. Players fight as either Asterix the Gaul or his best friend, Obelix, as they take on the might of the oppressive Roman Empire. 

Asterix and Obelix each have standard jump/attack controls, as well as a dash attack activated by tapping the joystick forward twice then pressing the attack button. Each character also possesses a powerful spinning arm attack, this is activated by holding the attack button for a short while until the character's face turns red, after which players must release the button. If the button is held down for too long, the character gets out of breath and takes a few seconds to recover.

The heroes' main foes are Roman legionaries and fat - occasionally horseback riding - centurions. After an enemy has been beaten enough to fall to the ground, he can be picked up and attacked again, the nature of the attack is dependent on which character picks them up; Asterix will spin the stunned enemy above his head, whereas Obelix smashes him repeatedly into the ground. These stunned enemies also act as temporary weapons, as they will cause damage to any other enemies they come into contact with.

Occasionally, a beautiful blonde lady called Panacea appears carrying a basket. If Asterix or Obelix walk up to her, she will give them a kiss, restoring some health and temporarily paralyzing any on-screen legionaries with embarrassment. Health can also be replenished by picking up the piles of red apples that litter the stages.

Asterix features eight different stages, called 'acts', all with a boss fight at the end. Every act from the second one onwards is based on a different book from the Asterix series and contains signature locations, objects and themed enemies, including pirates, thieves and Indian guards. 

Bonus levels appear after certain stages, featuring either a timed chariot race, or a timed barrel-smashing sequence on board a sailing ship. The game's eight different stages are:
* First Act: Village
* Act 2: Asterix in Egypt
* Act 3: Asterix in Britain
* Act 4: Asterix and the Admirable Panacea
* Act 5: Asterix in Spain
* Act 6: Asterix and the Magic Carpet
* Act 7: Asterix Vs Caesar</desc>

Battletoads (c) 1994 Electronic Arts

Battletoads is a (mostly) horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up in which up to three players take on the roles of Rash, Pimple, or Zitz and must punch and kick their way through six enemy-infested stages to save their alternate universe from the Dark Queen.

The Toads each vary in fighting style: Rash is nimble, Pimple is burly and strong, and Zitz is a balance of the two. Each Toad also has its own signature exaggerated power and attack, in which their limbs turn into objects such as axes and drills.

In a visually unique twist, the Toads can knock the game's enemies 'off-screen' so that they appear to fly towards the players, breaking the fourth wall. Enemies include aliens, mutant rodents and snowmen.

The game's stages, in addition to having their own unique visual theme, often differ in gameplay style. Some levels are Double Dragon-style 2.5D brawlers, while others are strictly two-dimensional, platform-like stages. In one level, the Toads wear jet-packs and descend a tunnel and in the final level, the Toads shoot enemies from a vehicle.</desc>

Charlie Ninja (c) 1994 Mitchell Corporation.

A colourful, 1 or 2-player platform shoot-em-up consisting of 5 stages, in which the player controls a Ninja who must jump and shoot his way through each of the game's stages, before taking on the archetypal end-of-level 'Boss'.

Bonuses can be picked up to increase the firepower, and barrels can either be smashed to reveal bonuses, or picked up and thrown at the enemies. In addition; the Ninja can perform high jump by pressing the JUMP button, then pressing it again while the Ninja is in the air. This is useful for avoiding enemies and essential for reaching high platforms.</desc>

魂斗羅 (c) 1987 Konami.
(Contra)

In 2631, a meteorite strikes the Galuga archipelago near New Zealand, carrying with it a dormant alien being. Two years later, a terrorist organization calling themselves Red Falcon takes over the island as part of their plot to invade the Earth. Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, of the Contra unit, are sent to the Oceania island to stop the evil threat.

'Contra' is a hectic one or two player platform shoot-em-up featuring 10 stages. In addition to the standard side-view levels, there are also "3D maze" stages in which the player must proceed through a series of corridors inside an enemy base, destroying various sensors, in order to reach the core of the base.

Each player's character is equipped with a semi-automatic machine gun with an unlimited amount of ammunition and can jump, move and fire in all eight cardinal directions. Players can also move and jump simultaneously while firing. Co-ordination of the character's movement is essential as a single hit from any enemy, bullet, or other hazard will instantly kill the player's character and also eliminate the current weapon from the player's inventory.

As players fight their way through the enemy-packed levels, additional weapons can be collected. If the player loses a life, they will also lose any weapon power-up they were carrying. Available weapons are:
Machine Gun: Auto-fire.
Spread gun [S]: Allows the player to fire 5 shots in an arc.
Laser: Will shoot a long laser that can take out many enemies in a row.
Fire Ball [F]: A gun which fires small fireballs in a corkscrew pattern.
Rapid Bullets [R]: Increases the firing rate of the player's currently equipped weapon. Works with the Machine Gun and Fire Ball.
Barrier [B]: Will make the player invincible for a few seconds.

The game consists of ten stages:
Stage 01: Jungle (horizontal scroll)
Stage 02: Inside Base 1 (3D maze)
Stage 03: Core of Base 1 (3D fixed)
Stage 04: Waterfall (vertical scroll)
Stage 05: Inside Base 2 (3D maze)
Stage 06: Core of Base 2 (3D fixed)
Stage 07: Snow Field (horizontal scroll)
Stage 08: Energy Zone (horizontal scroll)
Stage 09: Hangar (horizontal scroll)
Stage 10: Alien Lair (horizontal scroll)</desc>

Dangun Feveron (c) 1998 Cave.

A vertically scrolling shoot-em-up from the undisputed masters of the genre, 'Cave', Dangun Feveron features the usual Cave trademarks of intuitive, power-up driven gameplay backed-up with superb graphics and sound.

Dangun Feveron features a very high level of player customisation. At the start of a new game, players are prompted to select 3 different ship attributes; the speed of ship they wish to pilot (from a choice of four), which of the 3 rapid-fire weapons they prefer, and their preferred choice of sustained-fire weapons (activated by holding down the FIRE button). This allows players to tailor the ship to suit their individual needs and gameplay styles, be it a fast-flying speeder with widespread shots to handle enemy squadrons, or a ship with a lower speed that makes it easier to negotiate the swathes of enemy bullets that often fill the screen.

Another of the game's selling points is the capture-and-score system. Initially, every enemy destroyed is worth only one point. However, whenever an enemy is destroyed, coloured spheres appear in its wake, each containing a trapped, human prisoner. The spheres can then be collected by the player to earn additional points. For each prisoner saved, the total points gained from each enemy killed increases by one. For example, saving 56 prisoners means every subsequent defeated enemy is worth fifty-seven points. When the spheres appear, they drift slowly towards the bottom of the screen, before moving back up towards the top where, if they are not collected in time, they drift out of the screen and beyond the player's reach. This resets enemy-destroyed score back to a single point per enemy. If the player loses all of their lives and chooses to 'Continue' the game, the rescue count is reset to zero.

Dangun Feveron's final distinction was in its use of music and sound effects, with the game's creators drawing heavily on the disco sound of the 1970s.</desc>

Demon Front (c) 2002 IGS Company, Limited.

Demon Front is a platform run 'n' Gun game for up to four players (two simultaneously) that is very reminscent of SNK's "Metal Slug" series, although there are significant additions to the gameplay. 

20 light years from Earth lies the planet of Andres, a peaceful and civilised place. In the year A.C. 2016 Andres experienced a solar eclipse that lasted for over three months. All living creatures were exposed to a strange, dark red light and many began to mutate in both appearance and character. Few inhabitants would survive the torture inflicted by these crazed mutants. 

A lucky few escaped and lived in exile. Four of the survivers decided to join forces, to fight back and overthrow the evil that dominates the planet.

Players can choose to take control of one of four characters: 
* Jake - A human male from earth
* Sara - A human female from Earth
* Dr. J - A scientist 
* Maya - A humanoid ape 

The game consists of six stages and can choose in what order they wish to tackle the first three. Once these are completed, the forth and fifth stages are unlocked. A powerful boss awaits players at the end of each stage.

Each player-character has their own unique flying pet hovering by their shoulder and holding down the fire button will unleash a special attack:
* Jake's pet is a small dragon that unleashes a barrage of flames. 
* Sara's pet is a rabbit that creates homing projectiles that freeze enemies. 
* Dr. J's pet is a one-eyed robot that creates a field of electricity.
* Maya's pet is a pterodactyl that creates wind blasts in a spread formation. 

The C button also turns the pets into a shield, which can protect against various projectiles. However, the pet has its own life bar and if it runs out, the pet disappears until the player loses a life, it respawns at the start of the next life. Health can be regained for the pet by knifing enemies up close. 

Players are initally armed with a weak unlimited ammo-pistol but powerful extra weapons can be picked up, including a machine gun and a freezing gun. These have limitied ammo, however.</desc>

Agent 17 (code name 'Otto') is to secure the top secret documents from the security building. The enemy spies are in pursuit and their orders are to stop him at any cost. Having made it to the top of a 30 story building, Agent 17 has to make his way down to the basement to get to the getaway car and save the documents. Enemy spies are everywhere and the documents are hidden behind the red doors (bonus points awarded). He has to open the door and keep moving. If either of them shoots the lights out there will be a temporary blackout. If Otto finds himself on top of the elevator the player will not be able to control the elevator. If he gets caught in the elevator he is a sitting duck and cannot duck the bullets. By using the escalator he can reach the basement quicker. Otto can defeat his enemy by jump kicking or firing at them. Help Otto to grab all the documents and escape the spies.</desc>

Elevator Action Returns (c) 1995 Taito.

Elevator Action Returns is a scrolling platform shoot-em-up for one or two players who each take on the role of a special task force operative and must foil a terrorist group that has planted nuclear bombs in various facilities. Players must also obtain the secret intelligence data scattered throughout each facility in order to disarm the bombs. 

The objective of the game is to enter all of the red-coloured doors in each stage, then proceed to the exit. If players miss one of the red doors, they will be unable to progress beyond a certain point. There are also blue-coloured doors and entering these will award the player a special item, these include health refills, special firearms, sub-weapons and bonus points.

The player's default weapon is a semi-automatic handgun with unlimited ammunition but more powerful weapons - either a missile launcher or machine gun - can be found. These have limited ammunition, however and if the ammo for either weapon runs out, players will revert to their default weapon. Extra ammunition for these weapons can occasionally be found, however. 

It's possible to conserve ammo by attacking an enemy at close range, triggering a melee attack rather than firing a weapon. When an enemy is defeated with a close-range attack, the amount of points awarded is doubled. Players can also attack the enemy with a jumping attack or can throw an explosive (which serves as the character's sub-weapon). Explosives are thrown by pressing the SHOOT and JUMP buttons simultaneously while standing or crouching and the type of explosive used depends on which character the player is using. 

Objects within the environment can also be used to fight enemies. Elevators can be used to crush enemies standing above or below one. There are also oil drums that can be exploded with gunfire, they will then leave a trail of fire that will burn any enemies that come into contact with it. During the latter half of the game, players will also have to deal with electric barriers that will harm both players and enemies alike.

Each player character has a health gauge that shows the amount of damage they have sustained and when the gauge reaches zero, the player will lose a life. Players can choose to play as one of three different characters:

* Kart Bradfield - The fastest and most agile of the group. His default gun is a Glock 18, which he can upgrade to either an AK-47 assault rifle or</desc>

エスプガルーダ (c) 2003 Cave Company, Limited.
(Espgaluda)

A great vertically scrolling manic shooter. 

In an otherwise peaceful world, the Shinra Empire began conquering nearby nations one by one to expand their territory gradually. Meanwhile, in the Shinra weapons lab, the Espgaluda project produced two successful prototypes: Agaha and Tateha. Fearing for their future, the project's head scientist, Hiodoshi, escaped with the two prototypes to a nearby kingdom, but time after were found by Shinra's troops and Hiodoshi was killed by the attack of the imperial army, the power of the galuda has awaken. 

You have the option of controlling one of two siblings each with different skills, Ageha  faster but with narrower shooting capabilities or Tateha slower but with a wider attack. As you fly through the various stages various mechanical enemies attack with a high number of bullets, often nearly filling the screen. Aside from the regular shots, Ageha and Tateha also have additional abilities which help the player navigate through the numerous bullets. The first is a guard barrier; when activated the player is immune to collisions and as a bonus when the barrier button is released a more powerful laser shot is fired. A meter at the bottom of the screen indicates how much power is left in the barrier. The second ability is called the Kakusei mode; when this mode is activated your character gender is altered and is able to fire a more powerful shot. More importantly, when this mode is activated all of the enemies and their bullets slow down considerably while the players speed remains the same making it easier to navigate through a tricky pattern of bullets. Activating Kakusei mode will rapidly deplete the players supply of green gems; since the number of gems isn't limitless the player may not be able to remain in Kakusei mode for long. When not in Kakusei mode additional gems can be collected by destroying the various enemies. If the player completely runs out of gems, enemy bullets begin travelling faster than usual. Another bonus in the game is gold inguts which greatly increase the players score. These are found when in Kakusei mode; when an enemy is destroyed, all of its bullets will turn into ingots which can be collected by the player.</desc>

Fantasia is a "Qix"-style adult puzzle game modeled heavily after the Kaneko game "Gals Panic!". It features photographic images of both Japanese and western models. The objective is to reveal 80% of the silhouetted girl's image within the time limit while avoiding the enemies.

To complicate things, there is a bar with a pointer at the top of the screen. If the pointer dips below a certain level (indicated by the change in color) the image will change to that of a monster. The pointer slowly creeps towards the monster side of the bar over time and moves dramatically towards the monster side whenever the player reveals a significant piece of the silhouette. Revealing the un-silhouetted part of the image moves the pointer back towards the girl side of the bar. If a round is completed while the monster's image is shown then the round must be repeated.</desc>

Gaia Crusaders (c) 1999 Noise Factory.

Gaia Crusaders is a one or two-player side-scrolling beat-em-up in which players must battle Satan and his army of demons that have captured and taken over the world. Players select a character from a choice of five combatants known as 'Elemental Warriors'. Each of the characters possesses either Wind strength, Fire strength, or a mix of the two. 

The game has the standard punch and kick attack moves as well as magical special moves. Combos can be strung together by switching quickly between kicking and punching. Players can also perform a 'super attack' by pressing the jump, punch and kick buttons simultaneously, this hits many enemies at once but costs the player character some health. It's also possible to raise a shield by pressing jump and kick simultaneously.

At regular intervals coloured spheres appear, players can pick these up to gain a magical attack. The effects of the magic attack differs depending on the player character. If the magic matches the character's elemental attribute (fire, wind or both), they will gain a special, screen-clearing attack. Otherwise, they earn a powerful special attack. 

In addition to the elemental spheres, there are two types of bombs that also appear, both of which detonate immediately once picked up. The first is an earthquake that hits all on-screen enemies and inflicts a large amount of damage. The second is a random bomb that sends out pillars of fire, hurting any enemies they come into contact with. There are also explosive boxes that can be kicked at enemies to keep them at bay. One last notable item is the sword, which functions much like weapons that can be found on the ground in many other beat 'em ups. A boss battle awaits players at the end of each stage.

Gaia Crusaders is heavily influenced by another scrolling beat-em-up, Capcom's 1989 classic, Final Fight and also, to a lesser degree, by Sega's Golden Axe (the latter being the use of the Magical Attack acting as a smart bomb).

The game's five selectable characters and their attributes are as follows:

** Fred Sathal - Magical Attribute: Fire and Wind **
Fred Sathal is one of the faster characters and has some very acrobatic combo moves.

** Jimi Isaak - Magical Attribute: Wind **
Isaak is the all-around fighter with average speed, defense and power.

** Kohen - Magical Attribute: Fire **

Golden Axe (c) 1989 Sega.

Golden Axe is a sideways scrolling beat-em-up set in a traditional fantasy world, in which up to three warriors take up arms to rescue the kidnapped King and his Queen from the evil Death Adder.

The game's three different playable characters are an Amazonian warrior named Tyris Flare, a Barbarian hero named Ax Battler, and a Viking dwarf named Gilius Thunderhead. Each character has a special attack move that is activated by pressing both JUMP and ATTACK at the same time. Also, double-tapping the joystick right or left will make the character charge and smash into opponents.

At certain points during the game, players will come across enemies riding creatures (such as dragons). If the player knocks the original rider from the saddle, the created can be mounted and used against the enemy.

At certain points during a level, as well as on the between-stage intermittent levels, Thieves appear carrying a sack on their back. Players can hit the Thieves causing them to drop food and magic potions - the latter of which are used to create a special magical attack that damages or kills all on-screen enemies.

Each of the game's heroes uses a different kind of magic: Ax Battler uses Earth magic, Tyris uses fire magic and Gilius uses lightning magic. In addition: each player character also carries a different weapon: Tyris and Ax Battler both use swords while Gilius wields an axe.

Golden Axe consists of 9 levels, although only 5 of these are true levels as every 2nd stage is a short intermittent level featuring only the sack-carrying Goblins.

Once Golden Axe has been beaten, an end sequence is a scene of a video arcade, in which the game's characters jump out of the arcade cabinet and chase the game's players out of the arcade and down the street.</desc>

Golden Axe - The Revenge of Death Adder (c) 1992 Sega.

Like it's legendary prequel, 1989's "Golden Axe"; 'Revenge' is sideways scrolling beat-em-up set in a traditional fantasy world, in which the evil 'Death Adder' has arisen to take over the lands. The game supports simultaneous four-player gameplay, with each player taking on one of the game's characters. The four available characters are 'Sternblade' (a barbarian warrior), 'Dora' (a female centaurian), 'Goah' (a giant with a dwarf sitting atop his shoulders) and 'Little Trix' (an agile, oriental-style warrior).

As with 'Golden Axe', as well as standard weapon attacks, each character has a special attack move that is activated by pressing both JUMP and ATTACK at the same time. Also, double-tapping the joystick right or left will cause the player to charge and smash into opponents. At certain points during the game, players will come across certain creatures and contraptions (such as dragons, giant scorpions and catapults) which, once the original occupier has been removed from the saddle, can be mounted and ridden/utilized to attack the enemy.

At certain points during a level, as well as at the end of each level, dwarfs appears carrying a sack on their back. Players can hit the dwarfs causing them to drop food and magic potions. During the course of the game, players will also come across numerous trapped prisoners. These can be released by either opening their cages (by pulling a rope or similar) or hacking at their foot manacles.

Unlike the linear level layout of its prequel, 'Revenge' offers the player a branching route through the game, adding to its variety and longevity.</desc>

Gradius (c) 1985 Konami.

Gradius is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player pilots a spacecraft known as the Vic Viper as they search through unexplored galaxies looking for a lost armada. These new galaxies are teaming with alien life set upon destroying the Viper. 

The game features a power-up system based on a selection meter at the bottom of the screen called a 'power meter', this allows players to 'buy' weapons and upgrades. To achieve this, players must destroy special individual enemies - usually red in colour - or enemy waves that then drop orange capsules. These capsules can be collected and used to upgrade the Viper's weapons. Each collected capsule advances the power meter by one step. Players can activate the highlighted item at any point, after which the power meter resets.

Players can carry up to six capsules at any one time, collecting a 7th capsule causes the power meter to reset to the beginning. The six available power-ups are:
* Speed-up
* Bombs
* Double
* Laser
* Option (orbs that track the player's movements and increase firepower)
* '?' (two shields attach to the front of the player's ships)

Occasionally, destroyed enemies will drop blue capsules, these act as single-use smart bombs that kill all on-screen enemies when collected. Game difficulty increases depending on how many power-ups the player has equipped, so it is sometimes advantageous to NOT power-up the player's ship too much.

Gradius features five stages with a large alien ship waiting at the end of each. The ship is called the 'Big Core' and to destroy it, players first have to destroy four barriers blocking a narrow channel on the front of the ship. Once these have been destroyed the core itself is exposed and shooting this will destroy the enemy ship. The end-of-game boss is a giant, disembodied brain.</desc>

Gradius II - GOFER no Yabou (c) 1988 Konami.

The third game in Konami's renowned Gradius series; the prequel being "Gradius [Model GX400]" and a spinoff called "Salamander [Model GX587]". Gradius II strictly adheres to the shoot-em-up template set out by its hugely successful predecessor, the game eschews the sideways/vertical scrolling alternate levels of Salamander and opts instead for Gradius sideways scrolling-only mechanic. This game is rightly considered to be one of the most demanding and difficult shoot-em-ups ever released.</desc>

Guardians / Denjinmakai II (c) 1995 Banpresto.

Guardians is a horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players featuring eight selectable characters. Controls consist of an eight-way joystick and three buttons; standard attack, jump and special attack. Pressing the standard attack button repeatedly when attacking will trigger a combo from the player-character. The final blow of the combo can be changed to a throw if the player moves the joystick in the opposite direction just before landing it. 

Enemies can be grabbed simply by walking into one of them. When an enemy is grabbed, the player can perform a grab attack by pressing the attack button or perform a throw by tilting the joystick left or right. A thrown enemy can be tossed at another for additional damage. Items such as weapons, health recovery items, and items awarding extra points can be picked up by standing over one and pressing the attack button. Weapons have limited uses and will disappear if the player is disarmed by an enemy too often or when the player moves to a new area.

Each player-character has both a life bar and a power meter. The power meter allows for the special attacks to be made, either by pressing both standard attack and jump simultaneously, or by pressing the special attack button. These powerful attacks reduce the power meter but it does replenish itself after a few seconds. However, some of the player's health is lost in the process. Health levels can be replenished by finding food that lies hidden in breakable crates scattered through the stages.

A powerful boss enemy awaits player at the end of each stage.</desc>

Guevara (c) 1987 SNK.

The country is struggling against the cruel domination of the King. The rebel guerrilla leader and his comrades attempt to secretly land on shore. The King's military is waiting for them, however, and the players must fight their way inland to reach and attack the enemy fortress.

In this, the pseudo-sequel to SNK's own superb "Ikari Warriors" (released 2 years earlier), players must once again shoot their way through a number of vertically scrolling levels, all packed with hoards of enemy soldiers, gun emplacements and vehicles. Each level also contains a number of captured prisoners tied to wooden stakes, and these can be rescued for extra points.

The players' munitions are deletable, and additional ammo/grenades must be picked up along the way; a number of gun upgrades can also be found. At various points in the game, players can also enter unoccupied enemy tanks, which provide increased firepower as well as resistance to enemy shots. Too many enemy hits, however, will eventually see the tank explode - this is proceeded by a warning flash to allow the player to leave the tank before the explosion takes place. Should the player be caught inside or near the tank when it explodes, a life is lost.

As with "Ikari Warriors", Guevara features full 360 degree gameplay with attacking troops appearing from all directions. The players' on-screen counterparts are able to rotate themselves accordingly.</desc>

Gun.Smoke is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set in the Wild West, in which the player takes the role of a Billy; a young Sheriff charged with hunting down and killing a number of infamous 'Wanted' outlaws.

Each level is packed with gun-toting bandits and the Sheriff must shoot his way through the stage, before finally taking on the wanted outlaw 'boss' character at the end. Each outlaw wields a special weapon unique to them, such as a Winchester rifle, knives, darts or boomerangs.

Shooting the barrels that litter the levels reveals power-ups such as boots (for extra speed), rifles (for increased range) and bullets (for rapid fire). The game's 3 directional fire buttons (for firing left, right or ahead) can be combined (pressed Simultaneously) to create a total of 8 different firing directions.</desc>

Hyper Duel also has a unique feature in that players can hold down a button and transform their ships in large robots; In robot form the players' firepower is drastically increased but the weapon no longer only fires forwards, and will track the players' joystick movements. The robots will return to ship form once the button is released.</desc>

Karate Blazers (c) 1991 Video System Company, Limited.

A horizontally scrolling fighting game for 1 to 4 players. Each playable character (chosen from Mark, Glen, Akira and Gil) kicks and punches their way through a number of enemy-packed levels. In addition to kicking and punching, each character also has their own unique 'special attack'; a move that injures multiple on-screen enemies at the cost of some of the player's health.

While in no way original (drawing most of its inspiration from Capcom's "Final Fight"), Karate Blazers is both hugely playable and very fast and frenetic, with the amount of on-screen enemies at times overwhelming. The graphics are also well drawn and nicely animated.</desc>

ケツイ ～絆地獄たち～ (c) 2003 Cave.
(Ketsui - Kizuna Jigoku-tachi)

The continuous industrialization that started in 1900, finally led to unavoidable consequences in the middle of the 21st century. The waterlevel rose worldwide and threatened many coastal countries. So the shorelines had to be modified In order to save the human civilization from drowning. It was a time of great confusion about the future, and nobody thought about war. Well, almost... There was one company called EVAC corporation, who made a great profit from underhand productions and exports of weapon systems. When the United Nations discovered their illegal trades, they pointed EVAC to the global ban of weapon imports and exports, and asked them to stop their productions and to destroy their weapon facilities immediately. EVAC rejected all accusations and refused to take any actions. So a preventive war was started by the United Nations to stop the EVAC corporation.</desc>

M.I.A. - Missing in Action (c) 1989 Konami.

M.I.A. Missing in Action is a horizontally-scrolling run 'n' gun platform game for one or two players in which Special Forces soldiers must penetrate enemy-packed combat zones to reach a POW compound and rescue captured prisoners. The rescued POWs must then be escorted safely through a final enemy-packed stage to the helicopter that awaits at the end. 

Players begin each stage armed with only a combat knife to protect them, but other weapons can be picked up from fallen enemy troops. The weapons are always carried by soldiers in red uniforms and range from an assault rifle, grenades, a flame-thrower and a bazooka. Players can carry more than one weapon and can cycle through them as needed. Each collected weapon has only a limited supply of shots.

The game's first four stages are presented in random order and may also be "mirrored", switching the action from from right-to-left instead of left-to-right, increasing the game's variety and adding replay value. The 'POW' and 'Helicopter' stages are always the last two stages, however. 

At the end of each stage players must fight off a wave of enemy troops as well as destroy gun emplacements and watch towers. Certain sections of each stage offer players a different route, with both platforms and underground tunnels that can be utilized and explored. At least one POW must be safely escorted to the rescue Chopper to complete the final mission, after which the game starts over with an increased level of difficulty.

The game consists of six stages:
* War-torn battlefield
* Airstrip
* Jungle
* Rail Yard
* POW Base
* Escort the POWs to the Helicopter

M.I.A. Missing in Action is the direct sequel to 1985's "Green Beret" but unlike its prequel, two-player games now have both players fighting side-by-side, rather than the alternating approach of the original game.</desc>

Mystic Warriors - Ikari no Ninja (c) 1993 Konami.

Mystic Warriors is a horizontally-scrolling platform beat-em-up for up to four players, in which the evil 'SKULL' organisation has taken over the world and driven its terrified civilians into hiding. Five Ninja warriors set about destroying SKULL and freeing the World from its grip.

Mystic Warriors features five selectable characters, one of which is shown being kidnapped by SKULL once players have made their character choices. What follows is eight levels of platform 'run-and-gun' action, with an end-of-level boss waiting at the end of each stage.

Players are armed with both Shuriken throwing stars and with a sword for close encounters. Numerous boxes are scattered throughout the levels (or are being carried by enemies), all of which contain bonus items such as weapon power-ups or energy-replenishing food. Other power-ups include an invulnerability shield (known as the "Shinobi Shield") which lasts a few seconds and a "Smart Bomb" power-up, which destroys all on-screen enemies. Some boxes also contain points-giving items, such as bags of money, jewellery and gold.</desc>

NAM-1975 (c) 1990 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].

NAM-1975 is a war themed shoot-em-up set during the final months of the Vietnam war and offers one or simultaneous two-player gameplay. The story begins with the two soldiers called Silver and Brown entering the war to rescue Dr. R. Muckly, an ex-scientist of the US Army who has been kidnapped by the 'Northside Terrorists'. Dr. Muckly's daughter, Nancy, has also been kidnapped and is presumed imprisoned.

As the game progresses it's revealed that Dr. Muckly is a madman who is building a gigantic laser cannon with which to take over the world, players must fight through enemy-packed stages to reach and defeat the evil scientist. The game is an into-the-screen shoot-em-up with the action viewed from a third-person perspective. Players can move left and right, as well as run and somersault to avoid the incoming enemy fire. 

Players are initially armed with only a standard infinite-ammo machine gun and ten grenades. When certain enemies are killed, however, they drop more powerful guns or grenades that can be collected and used by the players. Weapons that can be picked up are:

* Balcan (A more powerful machine gun)
* Flamethrower (for taking out ground units only)
* Missile Launcher. 
* Grenades
* Spark Bomb
* Napalm Bomb.

Occasionally, an enemy soldier will appear holding a hostage. If players kill the soldier and save the hostage, the hostage joins the player and shoots at enemies until either the player is killed or reaches the end of the stage.

The final battle against Dr. Muckly does not allow continues and if players lose all of their lives during the battle, the game is over.</desc>

Pocket Fighter (c) 1997 Capcom.

A superb, abstract and humorous fighting game featuring miniaturized renditions from several Capcom fighting games; including the legendary "Street Fighter" series, as well as "Darkstalkers" and the little-known "Red Earth".

During a bout, players will be able to release coloured gems from successful attacks against their opponent, as well as from wooden chests that regularly appear. Collecting these gems will 'power-up' the player's character, giving them more powerful attacks. There are two bars and three sub-bars in the interface. The two main bars are the life bar and the super bar; the first indicates the player's health and the second their ability to throw super combos. The Super Bar itself can be filled up to nine levels, allowing players to execute more super combos. Each super combo has a level assigned to it, and it uses Super Bars depending on it.

The 3 sub-bars show the level of 3 of each player's special moves. Each character has at least three special moves, as shown in the sub-bars, and each of these corresponds to a color. Some characters have one or two additional Special Moves that aren't affected by sub-bars. Each time a player shoots their opponent, gems pop out of him or her, and the attacker can take them to power up their own special moves according to the colors.

There are 4 buttons: PUNCH, KICK, SPECIAL, and TAUNT. The Special button is a chargeable move that cannot be blocked and upon impact drops gems in the opponent's possession. More gems will be dropped depending on how much the player charges the attack. Holding Down, Forward or no direction at all when using the Special button will cause a specific gem color to drop from the enemy. Holding Back along with the Special button allows for a defense that is specific against the unblockable Special attacks. Other kinds of attacks do no damage when blocked, and unlike most 2-D fighting games, this includes special and super moves.

Pocket Fighter also features Flash Combos in which a player can execute a combo by pressing the KICK or PUNCH button after they have hit their opponent using the PUNCH button for a total of 4 hits. Flash Combos will usually cause a player's fighter (except Ryu) to change into various costumes during the sequence, and perform a powerful attack in the end. This final hit is usually the hardest in the sequence to connect with. These costumes range from uniforms (such as traffi</desc>

Pretty Soldier Sailormoon (c) 1995 Banpresto.

A 1 or 2-player sideways scrolling beat-em-up sees the Sailor Senshi fighting their way through five levels of anime-based combat. Each Sailor Soldier - chosen from a selection of 5, stiletto and mini skirt-wearing combatants - can punch, kick, jump, and throw their enemies; before finally reaching the traditional end-of-level boss.

As with Capcom's "Final Fight", and indeed many other games of the genre, items that aid the player are either dropped by beaten enemies or revealed after hitting certain obstacles and containers. Food can be used to replenish lost health and various trinkets can be picked up for bonus points. Finally, magic crystals can be found and are needed to activate the 'special attack' move. This works in a similar way to Sega's "Shinobi", with every enemy on the screen taking a hit.

Players must have at least one crystal to use the Special attack and up to 5 crystals can be carried at once. The more crystals the player holds when the special attack is utilized, the more effective it is against the game's enemies. Each level features its own unique, anime style animation. On level five, Sailor Soldier's signature attack move, from the original Japanese anime upon which the game is based, makes an appearance.</desc>

Shadow Force - Henshin Ninja (c) 1993 Technos.

Shadow Force is a side-scrolling platform beat-em-up for one or two players, who choose to play as one of four Ninjas and must use all the means at their disposal to free the world from the grip of the evil Dr. Wong and his terrifying 'Theaser' organization.

Shadow Force has 6 buttons: 2 for punches (low and high) 2 for kicks (low and high) 1 for jumping and 1 for possessing an enemy. Additional attack moves can be utilised by moving the joystick up or down and pressing punch and kick buttons. It's also possible to combine punch and kick attacks to obtain different combos and while the enemies can do the same, the number and variation of their attacks is generally lower than those available to the players.

In addition to being able to possess nearby enemies, Shadow Force also features something else new to the side-scrolling beat-em-up genre; at the end of each stage players take part in a bonus round consisting of a one-on-one fight. 

Players can choose to start on any one of the first three stages and the game features 14 different possible endings.</desc>

Snow Bros. - Nick &amp; Tom (c) 1990 Toaplan.

One or two players take on the roles of snowmen Nick and Tom as they battle a variety of monsters over fifty platform-based, single screen levels. 

The snowmen can throw snowballs at the enemies with the aim of encasing them completely in snow. The encased enemies can then be kicked in order to destroy them and this is achieved by standing next to the snowball and pressing the "kick out" button. This sends the giant snowball flying around the screen, killing any enemies that lay in its path. 

If players take too much time to complete a stage, an evil pumpkin head will appear and try to kill them. The pumpkin is invincible but can be stunned with snowballs. After a short time the evil pumpkin will spawn ghosts that can travel freely around the stage as they seek out Nick and Tom. These ghosts can't be killed or stunned, so the player's only hope is to avoid them while eliminating the remaining standard enemies, to move on to the next screen as soon as possible.

When players defeat an enemy, it may drop a coloured potion bottle. These can be picked up and act as power-ups:
* Yellow = Long shot
* Red = Speed up
* Blue = Bigger snowballs (encases monsters quicker)
* Green = Inflates the players like a balloon and lets them fly around the screen, killing any monsters they touch.

Every 10th level features a battle with a large end-of-level boss.</desc>

Street Fighter III - 3rd Strike: Fight For The Future (c) 1999 Capcom.

Street Fighter III 3rd Strike is a one-on-one fighting game for one or two players and is the second follow-up to "Street Fighter III", following "Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact". 

3rd Strike increased the character roster by adding five new characters, notably including the legendary Chun-Li. New characters Remy, Makoto, Q, and Twelve were also added, bringing the total number of playable fighters to twenty. Also re-introduced was the fan-favourite 'Destroy the Car' bonus stage. 

One of the new gameplay mechanics introduced in "3rd Strike" is the Guard Parry, also known as the 'Red Parry', which allows players to parry during guard stun, providing the timing is correct. Another new feature is after-match player evaluations in which the winner of a two-person match is graded in Offense, Defence, Tech and Extra. In single-player Arcade mode the player will always be evaluated, even in event of a loss. The grades range from E (lowest) to MSF, or Master Street Fighter (highest).

The single-player mode consists of fighting ten regular opponents, which includes a character-specific rival as the penultimate opponent and 'Gill' as the final boss for each of the characters except for Gill himself, whose final boss is Alex. Despite his status as a regularly selectable character, the CPU version of Q can only be fought in the single-player mode as a secret challenger. Clearing the game with every character, including Gill, unlocks the extra options, including infinite super arts, will be available for toggling on and off. The full roster of playable characters are as follows:

** Returning 2nd Impact characters **

AKUMA
Appears in 2nd Impact as a secret character and has a non-playable "Shin Akuma" version which can be selected in the Dreamcast version of the game in 2nd Impact. 

ALEX
The lead character of the Street Fighter III games. He fights with close-range wrestling and quick rushing attacks. His goal is to avenge the defeat of his friend, Tom, at the hands of Gill. 

DUDLEY
A dandy British boxer who, having been knighted since making a comeback and winning the championship title, enters the tournament to train for a contest that will be held in the presence of the British Royal Family. 

ELENA
An African princess who uses the fighting style of capoeira. She seeks to make new friends.

Street Fighter III - New Generation (c) 1997 Capcom Company, Limited.

A New Generation of Street Fighters! Features larger characters sprites than previous Street Fighter games with the smoothest, most detailed 2-D animation ever made at the time of its release, a level of quality that is yet to be matched by any other 2-D game outside of the Street Fighter III series as of 2004; some complain that too many things are animated and each animation contains too many frames, slowing down the pace of the game.</desc>

Strikers 1945 (c) 1995 Psikyo.

In 1945, the second world war ended. Soon, there was peace, but an organization of high-ranking military officers from all over the world form a global army known as CANY. Their mission was to conquer the world. CANY activity was found in areas like the Soviet Union, America, Japan, and even Germany. It is revealed that CANY had weapons never seen before from rockets to mechanical walkers. The world quickly formed a group of pilots and planes called the Strikers whose mission is to rid of CANY from the world.</desc>

Sunset Riders (c) 1991 Konami.

Sunset Riders is a horizontally-scrolling platform shoot-em-up for up to four players set in America's Wild West. Four sharpshooter bounty hunters (Steve, Billy, Bob and Cormano) set out to claim the bounties for killing the most wanted outlaws in the West, before a final showdown against the infamous Sir Richard de la Rose.

The action takes place both on foot and on horseback, with play sometimes broken up with a wild west pursuit; such as having to run along the backs of a herd of fleeing Buffalo. Each level ends with players entering a one-on-one battle against one of the wanted men they have been pursuing. 

Power-ups and bonus items can be obtained by entering saloons or defeating certain sack-carrying bandits. The power-ups comes in the form of either a golden sheriff badge (that gives the player's weapon auto-fire) or a silver badge that gives the player a second gun (making it possible to shoot in two directions simultaneously). Both power-ups can be equipped at the same time. 

Other weapons that can be used by players include sticks of dynamite carried by female bandits that can be thrown back at the enemy before they explode and a mounted Gatling gun available only in the last stage. 

A bonus mini-game appears at the end of Stages 2 and 5 in which players must shoot at enemies from a first-person perspective before the timer runs out.

Sunset Riders features eight stages of play.</desc>

Here is a list of changes from "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers": 
* Modified title screen with new music. 
* The 'Character Select' screen's background music is changed. The new song is based on the title screen theme of the CPS1 SFII games. 
* After each character's ending, a new piece of artwork is displayed for that character. In Ryu's new art, the kanji 'Fuurinkazan' are written on his belt. These are the same kanji that are displayed on the breakable signs in Ryu's stage in "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" and "Hyper Street Fighter II - The Anniversary Edition". 
* New artwork in Dhalsim's ending. The picture of Dhalsim and his son is replaced with a new picture of Dhalsim with his wife and son. The photograph on the wall now shows Dhalsim with Sagat and Vega (It used to show two generic guys). 
* All bonus games have been removed.</desc>

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Turtles in Time (c) 1991 Konami Industry Company, Limited.

The sequel to 1989's hugely successful original, 'Turtles in Time' once more sees the four heroes taking on Shredder and his army. Gameplay remains similar to the original game, but the experience is enhanced further with the obligatory improved graphics and sound effects. 'Turtles in Time' also features a larger variety of levels, as now the battle between good and evil rages across time as the Turtles travel to prehistoric, pirate and Wild West times in their pursuit of the elusive Splinter. 

Yet again, Konami's mastery of the genre was in evidence as the manic energy and humour of the cartoon and comic-book series upon which the game is based was captured perfectly.</desc>

Tumble Pop (c) 1991 Data East Corporation.

Tumble Pop is a platform game for one or two players in which the aim is to clear each level of enemies by sucking them into - then ejecting them from - a portable vacuum-cleaner. 

Holding down the fire button sucks the enemies into the cleaner, releasing the button causes them to be expelled back out. Ejected enemies act as projectiles that can damage and kill any other on-screen enemies that they collide with. All enemies must be killed before players can progress to the next stage. 

Throughout the game, letters of the alphabet randomly appear in bubbles. These can be collected to eventually spell the word "TUMBLEPOP". Once this has been achieved players are transported to a time-limited bonus level, giving them the opportunity to earn bonus points and extra lives. 

If players take too long to finish a stage, a Dracula-like enemy appears. If it touches a player before all enemies have been eliminated, a life is lost. This also applies to the Boss levels. 

The game feature ten stages, with the first eight set in different parts of the World and the final two set in Outer Space. Each stage has its own themed enemies and level bosses and players can choose to start the game on any of the eight World-based stages. The levels and enemies are: 
*Moscow: Set at the Moscow-state circus, enemies are clowns, invisible conjurers and fire spitters. The boss is a giant clown hanging from helium balloons who juggles bombs. 
*Egypt: Set near the pyramids and Sphinx at Giza, enemies include fire spitters and mummies. The boss is a giant genie who spits fireballs. 
*Paris: Set near the Arc de Triomphe, all of the enemies are robots. The boss is a large flying robot that sends out flying hands. 
*New York City: Set near the Statue of Liberty and World Trade Center, the enemies are pumpkin-headed zombies and octopuses. The boss is a giant octopus. 
*Rio de Janeiro: Set near the statue of Christ the Redeemer, enemies are fire monsters. The boss is a fire dragon. 
*Antarctica: Populated by snowmen, snowmen armed with shovels and hairy yeti-like monsters. The boss is a giant snowman wearing a bucket on its head. 
*Australia. Enemies are carnivorous plants, cavemen and mud men. The boss is a giant two-headed carnivorous plant. 
*Japan: Set at Mount Fuji, enemies are yureis, kappas and skeletons. The boss is a giant pile of daruma dolls. 
*Outer Space: Enemies are grey aliens and spacemen</desc>

Turbo Force is even more of a direct predecessor to Sonic Wings than is Rabio Lepus: Turbo Force features vertical scrolling gameplay very similar to that of the Sonic Wings series along with a nearly identical power-up system. The only differences in power-ups are that the vehicle slowly loses power even if not damaged, and that instead of a bomb that can be deployed at the player's discretion, the special weapon detonates as soon as its power-up is touched.</desc>

Undercover Cops (c) 1992 Irem.

Undercover Cops is a horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for up to three players in which Dr. Clayborn and his henchmen have taken control of the city. Police Commissioner Gordon has called on three of New York's Finest undercover cops: Bubba, an ex-professional football player; Flame, a former Miss America; and Claude, a retired philosophy teacher. They must fight every lackey and vanquish Dr. Clayborn in order to restore law and order to the city. 

Besides the usual human thugs, players fight strange mole creatures and mutants with jet packs and blades for hands. Players can never use enemy weapons, but the stages contain objects that can be picked up and used instead, These include burning oil drums, steel girders, concrete columns that shatter on impact, boxes of hand grenades and giant fish. 

As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is more powerful than standard attacks but each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's health is lost.

Player characters can eat mice, frogs, birds and snails to restore their health. The game consists of five stages with a powerful enemy boss character waiting at the end of each one.</desc>

Vampire - The Night Warriors (c) 1994 Capcom Co, Limited.

Vampire - The Night Warriors is a one-on-one beat-em-up in which a powerful alien demon called 'Pyron' has invaded Earth to add to his collection of the planets that he has already devoured. Enter the world's most fearsome monsters who, ironically, are Mankind's last line of defense.

The game features ten playable characters (Demitri Maximoff, Jon Talbain, Victor von Gerdenheim, Lord Raptor, Morrigan Aensland, Anakaris, Felicia, Oboro Bishamon, Rikuo and Sasquatch) with two non-playable boss characters - Huitzil and Pyron - as the final opponents of the single-player game.

Night Warriors uses the gameplay system Capcom developed for their "Street Fighter II" series, but with several new gameplay additions, such as Air Blocking, Crouch Walking and Chain Combos. 

The game featured a 'Special' meter similar to the 'Super Combo' gauge from "Super Street Fighter II Turbo", in which players could fill the gauge to perform either a unique combo-type move or a powered-up version of one of their specials (called "EX", and a concept which would appear in later Night Warriors games as well as "Street Fighter III"). 

Unlike the 'Super Combo' gauge', the Special in Night Warriors gradually depletes unless players performs their super move. This prevents players from preserving their super moves for later use.</desc>

Vigilante (c) 1988 Irem Corp.

A sequel to Irem's legendary 1984 beat-em-up, "Kung-Fu Master", Vigilante sees the hero's girlfriend, Madonna, kidnapped by a gang of thugs and driven away in the back of their van. The vigilante must fight through five enemy-packed levels to rescue his girlfriend. As with "Kung-Fu Master", a tough guardian enemy awaits the player at the end of each level. The guardians must be defeated as quickly as possible as their energy bars will replenish in between the player's attacks.

A weapon, in the form of Nunchakas, can occasionally be found and picked-up; adding to the player's 'kick' and 'punch' fighting moves. Some of the game's many enemies are also armed, with either clubs, chains, knives or guns. The game ends once Madonna is rescued.</desc>

Violent Storm (c) 1993 Konami Company, Limited.

Violent Storm is a sideways-scrolling beat-em-up for up to three players set in the aftermath of World War III. The survivors of the war are attempting to rebuild their world but are being terrorised by violent gangs . Three vigilante heroes called 'Boris', 'Wade' and 'Kyle' are trying to protect the citizens but are hampered in their efforts by the evil and corrupt 'GELD' gang. As the heroes are patrolling the streets, they see their friend, Sheena, kidnapped by the gang. The vigilantes must fight through seven enemy-packed stages to rescue their friend and destroy the gang.

As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is powerful enough to fell several enemies at once, but with the trade-off that each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's health is lost. Health levels can be replenished by finding the food that lies hidden in breakable crates and barrels. 

Some of the gang members will drop a weapon when they are felled. These weapons can then be picked up and used by the players. Destructible crates and barrels also contain weapons and random bonus items. Stunned enemies fall to the ground and can still be attacked while prone.</desc>

X-Men (c) 1992 Konami.

X-Men is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for up to four players. The X-Men's mission is to find and rescue Professor X, who has been captured by evil mutants and is now being held prisoner by Magneto.

Each X-Man character has an 'Attack', 'Jump' and 'Mutant Power' button. The mutant power attack is a powerful special move unique to each X-Man. While it inflicts a lot of damage on the enemies, the trade-off is that each usage removes 3 bars from the players health meter (a full meter has 10 bars). Each level ends with a face-off against a powerful mutant boss character.

The game has six stages, with the final one set on 'Asteroid M', Magneto's base. The defeated mutant bosses from the previous levels each make an appearance (albeit in a less powerful form) before the final encounter with Magneto himself.

Players can chose from 6 X-Men characters, they are:
Cyclops 
Colossus 
Wolverine 
Storm 
Nightcrawler 
Dazzler</desc>

Yie Ar Kung-Fu (c) 1985 Konami Industry Company, Limited.

Yie Ar Kung-fu is a single-player one-on-one fighting game in which the player takes on the role of 'Oolong' who must fight and defeat eleven martial arts masters. His ulimate goal is to win the title of "Grand Master" and honour the memory of his father, who was killed while fighting the current grand master.

The player faces a variety of opponents, each with a unique appearance and fighting style. Some opponents are also armed, with weapons including nunchaku, throwing stars and a club. The player can perform up to 16 different moves using a combination of buttons and joystick movements while standing, crouching or jumping. Moves are thrown at high, middle, and low levels. 

Yie Ar Kung-Fu plays incredibly quickly, with the player having to be constantly on the move to avoid getting 'pegged in' by some of the game's tougher opponents. There is no time limit in which the opponent must be defeated but Oolong possesses a finite amount of health, represented by a health bar at the top of the screen. Once Oolong's health is fully depleted, the match is over.

The first five fights take place in front of an animated waterfall, while the remaining six are set in front of an oriental pagoda. 

The eleven opponents Oolong must face are:
* Buchu - A sumo wrestler, strong but slow.
* Star - The first female opponent, throws shuriken for long-range attacks.
* Nuncha - Uses nunchaku for close and mid-range attacks.
* Pole - Uses a wooden staff for close and mid-range attacks.
* Feedle - Attacks with duplicates of himself.
* Chain - Uses a chain for long-range attacks.
* Club - Uses a large club for close and mid-range attacks.
* Fan - The second female opponent, throws fans for long-range attacks.
* Sword - Uses a sword for close and mid-range attacks.
* Tonfun - Uses tonfa (wooden batons) for close and mid-range attacks.
* Blues - Extremely fast and very powerful.</desc>

Double Dragon (c) 1987 Technos Japan Corp.

Double Dragon is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players, featuring twin brothers and martial arts masters, "Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee". The brothers must defeat the savage street gang known as the 'Black Warriors' to rescue Billy's kidnapped girlfriend, Marian. Standing between the brothers and Marian are four huge, colorful and varied levels; each populated with a wide variety of thugs.

Many of the game's enemies carry weapons (knives, baseball bats etc.) and should Billy or Jimmy manage to knock the weapons from the enemies' hands, the heroes can pick the weapons up and use them against the enemies.

The Black Warriors is made up of six distinct enemy characters- plus Willy, the game's final boss - with each differing in both physical appearance and fighting style. The members of the Black Warriors consist of the following fighters: 
* Williams - A street punk in a tank top. In addition to the standard punches and jump kicks, his signature technique is a body blow to the stomach. He also wields weapons such as baseball bats, knives and dynamite sticks.
* Rowper - A punk who wears matching-colored pants and shirtless vest. He wields all the same weapons as Williams, but can also lift and throw heavy objects such as oildrums, boxes and stones.
* Linda - Female punk who usually carries a whip. She's not very strong, as she falls down to ground with a couple of punches or a single kick (because of this, she is the only regular-sized enemy who cannot be placed on a headlock).
* Abobo - A tall, big-muscled bald guy. His attacks includes punches, a standing kick and a body toss. He can also lift and throw heavy objects like Rowper. Due to his large size, he cannot be put into a headlock.
* Boss 1 - The first boss, a head-swap of Abobo with a Mr. T-style mohawk and beard. Fights just like Abobo, only with an added double-handed slap. Unlike Abobo, he does not use weapons. A green version of him appears as the Mission 3 boss.
* Boss 2 - The second boss. A head swap of the player who uses almost all the same techniques. 
* Willy - The game's final boss, armed, somewhat unfairly, with a machine-gun.

Double Dragon was a huge success due to the many game-play innovations it brought to the genre (see TRIVIA for details), but it demonstrates its final moment of inspired genius at the very end of the game. Should both players still be alive after the final boss has been defeated</desc>

Double Dragon II - The Revenge (c) 1988 Technos Japan Corp.

Following his defeat at the end of the original Double Dragon, Willy, the leader of the Black Warriors, retaliates against Billy and Jimmy Lee by murdering their friend, Marian, leaving the brothers with the task to avenge her death.

The sequel to Double Dragon is essentially an upgraded version of the original game, but with with a two-way attacking system similar to one previously used in Technos Japan's 1986 arcade game "Renegade". Many of the attacks and combos from the original "Double Dragon" are retained, as well as new techniques including the invincible Cyclone Kick.

The stages and weapons are redesigned versions of items previously featured in the original game. There are a few new traps such as a bulldozer in the middle of Mission 3 and all of the transition sequences between stages are now done with the character entering the next level via a lift, making it impossible to carry one weapon to the next area.

Most of the enemy characters return from the original Double Dragon, with some given facelifts, but the stage bosses are all new. The enemies are as followed:
* Williams - Has a wilder face and longer hair. He can now run towards the player and do cartwheels. He throws his knives in mid-air and sometimes carry a shovel which he throws towards the player.
* Rowper - Has a beard and eye-patch, but otherwise is more or less identical to his original self. He carries shovels and can sometime pick up large objects.
* Linda - She now has a mohawk and face paint. She can also jump off platforms and do the elbow strike against the player. In addition to the ball and chain, she also carries grenades and knives.
* Oharra - A strongman with a clean-shaved face. Replaces Abobo from the first game and has the same attacks.
* Bolo - A head-swap of Oharra with long hair and beard. Replaces the mohawked head-swap of Abobo from the first game.
* Jeff - Same as his original self, but now carries grenades.
* Burnov - The boss of Mission 1. An obese wrestler whose face is concealed with a mask. He grabs the player and throws similar punches in the face. After dying, he will stand up and yell, disappearing in front of the player and leaving only his clothes. In later encounters, he will revive himself at least once.
* Abore - The boss of Mission 2. A huge suspender-wearing strongman with Terminator-like sunglasses. His slaps and shoulder tackles do massive d</desc>

Double Dragon 3 - The Rosetta Stone (c) 1990 Technos Japan Corp. 

A mysterious fortune teller warns Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee about the rise of a powerful enemy in Egypt. Since the Lee brothers are looking for a true challenge to put their martial arts skills to the ultimate test, they agree to face this mysterious new enemy. They embark on a world quest - joining up with new allies in the process - and try to lay claim to the famous 'Rosetta Stone'.

Techniques from the previous games such as the hair grab and the elbow punch are gone, but new ones are added such as the belly-to-back throw and the back-to-back hurricane kick, as well as the ability to dash by tapping the joystick left or right twice.

The game features weapon shops that allows the player to purchase power-ups by inserting additional tokens. The power-ups differ between stages differ between stages and are available as followed.
* Extra Guys - Allows the player to control a new character who replaces the current fighter when he dies. There are three character types in addition to the Lee brothers.

- The Chin Brothers (Seimei, Taimei, Sinmei) - Chubby Chinese men with powerful attacks.
- The Oyama Brothers (Masao, Kunio, Akira) - Japanese karate masters dressed in gis specializing in speedy attacks.

Evil is lurking in Dead End City. In a turf war, the Dead End Gang has kidnapped Kute Kate from the rivals, the Cobras. The Cobras set out to save her and stop the expansion of the Dead End Gang in Vendetta.

The Dead End Gang is looking to expand their territory, so the Cobras must infiltrate every area around the city. First, they must gain entrance to Dead End City. Relying on their fighting skills, the Cobras face a multitude of enemies. However, each member is up for any challenge from the Dead End Gang. The Cobras are a powerful team consisting of: Blood, an ex-prize fighter; Hawk, a former professional wrestler; Boomer, trained in the martial arts; and Sledge, an ex-military convict. Together they must destroy members of the Dead End Gang to get to the leader, Faust, who knows where Kute Kate is being held.

With fists of fury, the Cobras make their way through various areas of Dead End City. They search the construction site for Kate, battling the humanoid weapon The Missing Link to gain information. From there, they are sent on futile chases through other sections of the city, including downtown, the waterfront, and the slums, where the final confrontation with Faust takes place. Throughout the game, the Cobras can pick up special weapons and food for more energy. Each player also has his own 'special attack' method to help defeat the toughest enemies.

Once Kute Kate is rescued and Dead End City is liberated, the Cobras victoriously start back to their home turf. However, much to their surprise, the entrance to their town is blocked by Dead End Gang bosses. The Cobras must gear up once more for the ultimate showdown to restore peace to Dead End City.</desc>

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 29 years ago:

Batsugun (c) 1993 Toaplan.

A vertically scrolling shoot'em up game. As is the standard with most arcade shooters, the player controls their ship with a joystick and two buttons. One button (Fire) shoots the main guns, and the other button (Bomb) releases a smart bomb that spreads huge energy balls all around the player's ship.

As enemies are destroyed, the player gains experience points that are separate from the score. For every 288 experience points gained, the main gun will 'level up', becoming much stronger. This is analogous to experience points and leveling up in role playing games. The weapon can only level up twice, so after it has achieved its maximum level, 288 experience points will grant the player an extra bomb.

The player can also grab P icons to increase the power of the current level gun. A maximum of five "P"s can be collected per experience level; getting more after this gives extra points instead.

Collecting B icons increases the number of bombs, to a maximum of 7.

Apart from destroying enemies, points can be gained from collecting golden V-shaped medals. After the level is finished, 3000 points are awarded for every small one, and 5000 points for every large one. If the player's ship is destroyed during a level, all medals collected are lost.</desc>
